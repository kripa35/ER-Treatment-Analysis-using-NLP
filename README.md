# ER-Treatment-Analysis-using-NLP
ER Treatment Analysis: Medication &amp; Chief Complaint Study


This repository contains analysis of Emergency Room (ER) treatment patterns, chief complaints, and their association with patient outcomes using Python, NLP, and statistical methods.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Drug Co-Occurrence & Prescription Analysis**  
   - Identify frequently co-prescribed medications and treatment patterns.  
   - Visualize relationships using heatmaps and network graphs.

2. **Chief Complaint NLP & Symptom Topic Discovery**  
   - Clean and normalize free-text complaints.  
   - Apply LDA topic modeling to identify symptom clusters.

3. **Outcome Validation & Risk Quantification**  
   - Assess associations between treatments/complaints and patient outcomes.  
   - Calculate odds ratios and p-values using Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests.
